# Silex packages

| Name | Directory | Repo | Description |
| ---- | --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Silex Puter Plugin | `packages/silex-puter` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-puter.git` | The **Silex Puter Plugin** brings Silexâ€™s professional website-building capabilities to the Puter environment, letting users create, save, and publish static websites directly in Puter. This plugin enables seamless integration, making it easier than ever to use Silex within Puter for web design and content management. |
| Silex plugins | `packages/silex-plugins` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-plugins.git` | Environment agnostic (node.js, browser, commonjs, esnext...) open architecture (plugin system) inspired by 11ty.dev config |
| Silex Plugin Starter | `packages/silex-plugin-starter` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-plugin-starter.git` | A good place to start writing a Silex plugin. It supports server and/or client side plugins, in Javascript and TypeScript. Check [Silex developer docs if you need help](https://docs.silex.me/en/dev) or [join the discussions in the forum](https://community.silex.me/) |
| Silex Platform by Silex Labs | `packages/silex-platform` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-platform.git` | This is also a good example on how to customize Silex. And it has a Dockerfile for easy deployment. |
| Silex core library | `packages/silex-lib` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-lib.git` | This repository is the core library of Silex, it is a nodejs server which serves the Silex editor and the websites created with Silex. The core library is used in the online version of Silex, in the desktop app, and in the nodejs integration. It is available as a npx cli, as a docker image, and as a npm/nodejs library. |
| Silex Dashboard | `packages/silex-dashboard` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/silex-dashboard.git` | Here is the source code of Silex dashboard. It is a [Silex](https://www.silex.me) plugin which can be installed to manage websites you will then edit in Silex. |

| node_modules Path | `packages/node_modules-path` | `git@github.com:lexoyo/node_modules-path.git` | Get the path of the `node_modules` folder in your scripts or CLI or `package.json`. This is useful when you are building a library that can either be used as an npm dependency or directly, [see this question on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44279838/copy-assets-from-npm). |
| Grapesjs Ui Suggest Classes | `packages/grapesjs-ui-suggest-classes` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/grapesjs-ui-suggest-classes.git` | A grapesjs plugin to enable auto-complete of classes in the SelectorManager UI  |

| GrapesJs Notifications Plugin | `packages/grapesjs-notifications` | `git@github.com:silexlabs/grapesjs-notifications.git` | Why this plugin? GrapesJs is a powerful framework to build no-code tools and allow users to create templates using a drag-and-drop interface. However, the framework does not offer a standard way of notifying users and each plugin implements its own, which is messy and not user friendly. This plugin provides a centralized notification system that can be used by all plugins to display messages to the user. |

> Auto generated submodules

## Instruction

To contribute to Silex you need to fork this repo then clone locally (mini 2CPU and 4GoRAM) this repo with its submodules, make sure you use the required nodejs version (nvm) and install its dependencies (you can replace `npm` with `yarn`):

* On github, fork this repo
* Be sure of your ssh key for gitlab and github configured (we use both for repos)
* Don't forget to verify if nodejs, nvm and npm are installed on your server
* Then clone and setup the project:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:<your github handle>/Silex.git --recurse-submodules -j8
$ cd Silex
$ nvm install # [optional] Get the node version from .nvmrc
$ npm install # Will install dependencies in all submodules too
$ npm start # Will run the Silex editor from packages/Silex
```

Then you can open your browser at [http://localhost:6800](http://localhost:6800) to see the Silex editor running locally.

When you are ready to contribute to a specific library or libraries, you can do the following:

* On github, fork the libraries you intend to contribute to, e.g. `silex-desktop`
* In your local clone of this meta repo, update submodule URLs to point to your own forks of each library, e.g:
  ```sh
  $ cd packages/silex-desktop
  $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your-username>/silex-desktop.git'
  ```
* Sync Changes: Once your contributions are merged into the main library repositories, they will automatically sync with the meta repository when submodules are updated.

Troubleshooting:

If you find your repositories in a strange state, e.g repositories are on commits instead of the main branch, or if your `npm install` fails... You can do this:
```
$ scripts/exec.js "git checkout {{branch}}" # checkout the default branch in all submodules
$ scripts/exec.js "npm install" # install dependencies in all submodules
$ cd packages/Silex && npm run build && cd ../.. # build the Silex editor
```

Useful commands

* Start Silex: `npm start` (or use `npm run start:debug`)
* Release a package (which is in packages/$PACKAGE_NAME) and bump version of a library and all its dependents: `scripts/release-version packages/$PACKAGE_NAME $VERSION`, then you probably want to `git push --follow-tags` the changed packages
* Add a project: `git submodule add $PACKAGE_GIT_URL packages/$PACKAGE_NAME`, then run `npm run doc`
* Update `package-lock.json` for a particular package: `npm i --package-lock-only --workspaces false` in the package directory
* Publish a new version of a package: `npm version --patch && git push --follow-tags` in the package directory

## Third party dependencies

* The excellent [GrapesJs framework](https://grapesjs.com/) used for the front end drag/drop feature
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used to build Silex
